<h2 align="center">Dataset generator</h2>

This simple repository provides implementation of full-image dataset generator. Result synthetic dataset is supposed to be used for CNN (single-shot detector) training.

## Dependencies

 - OpenCV 3.x and higher

## About the tool

Tool works on simple principle of placing objects to the images of background on the random positions and can work in two different ways.

### 1) Using many cropped objects
Cropped objects (used for classifier training) are placed to the images of background using Poisson blending [1].

![alt text](data/visual/cropped_2.png "Cropped 2")

### 2) Using few transparent objects

Before transparent objects are placed into background, few effects are applied to synthetically modify appearance of the object.

<br><b>Then objects are placed into background</b>:<br>

## Annotations

This tool is using YOLO [2] annotation format:

```
<object_class> <x> <y> <width> <height>
```

## Usage

 - Place images of the background (where objects should be placed, in case of traffic signs images should originate from the city-env) to the data/backgrounds
 - In case of using transparent objects, place them to `data/transparent` folder, otherwise to the `data/cropped`. Place each class to separate folder and save class name to imgClass file in same folder.
 - In the Makefile, select (comment/uncomment) effects you want to be applied
 - Type `make` in the root folder
 - In case of using transparent objects, type `make runt`, otherwise `make runc`
 - Generated dataset should be in the `out/` folder
